    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am a software developer with experience in a wide variety of different programming 
        paradigms and languages, although my primary expertise is in .NET / C#,
        Python, and a little bit of Haskell. I have worked in many different industries 
        including the oil / gas industry, the financial industry, and the insurance industry. This varied 
        industry experience has opened up my perspective, allowing me to view problems from many
        different angles.
