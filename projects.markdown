# Projects

Here are a few of the open-source projects that I have worked on:   

## EBCDIC Compare Tool  

This tool can perform a comparison of IBM EBCDIC-encoded files. The EBCDIC Compare Tool is
a WPF desktop application.

## YEG Photos  

Developed for the Open Data Hackathon 2016 in Edmonton, YEG Photos is an application that presents geo-tagged photos of Edmonton, AB, Canada and displays them on an interactive map. The years 
in which the photos were taken span from 2016 all the way back to 1883! It is fascinating to see the evolution of Edmonton over time! YEG Photos helps you discover Edmonton's past in an incredibly 
visual way.

## Haskell Client For lightning-viz

[lightning-viz](http://lightning-viz.org) is a data-visualization server
providing API-based access to reproducible, web-based, interactive visualizations. I created a
Haskell client that can interact with the lightning-viz REST API.

## MyMenu iPad Application

As part of a class project, 5 developers and I created an iPad application for
a startup called MyMenu. MyMenu had the goal of helping people with dietary
constraints (such as allergies, vegetarianism or Celiac disease) improve their
experience while dining out.

A user would create a dietary profile, which includes what items the user is able
to consume. Once the dietary profile is created, the user is brought to a screen containing
the restaurants that contain items on the menu that the user is able to consume. At this point,
the user can browse the menu of each respective restaurant.

## YEG Traffic Volume Migration  

The City of Edmonton released traffic volume data in the form of thousands of ill-formed
spreadsheets. My traffic volume migration tool liberates this data from these spreadsheets,
geocodes the intersections, and migrates it to an easy-to-query database.
