title: Making a NES Emulator In Haskell (Part 1)
tags: Haskell

A few days ago, I saw an article by Michael Fogleman on Medium that described
his experience with developing a 
[NES emulator in Go](https://medium.com/@fogleman/i-made-an-nes-emulator-here-s-what-i-learned-about-the-original-nintendo-2e078c9b28fe#.vzzt283ps). This 
article reminded me of a NES emulator project that I started a few years ago, but never 
actually got around to finishing.
