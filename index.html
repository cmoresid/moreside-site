<p>
    Hello there! My name is Connor Moreside. I am an enthusiastic polygot software 
    developer. Currently, I am using .NET / C#, Python, Haskell, and Node.JS for
    the various projects that I am currently working on. I love learning new ways of
    solving the difficult problems that crop up in software development.
