<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hello there! My name is Connor Moreside. I am a full stack developer currently based
    out of Edmonton, Canada. Over the past couple of years, I have primarily been working with
    the .NET / C# stack, developing enterprise applications for various large companies.
</p>
<p>
    I am also a strong proponent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_technology" target="_blank">civic technology</a>,
    and more specifically civic tech which utilizes
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data" target="_blank">open data</a>. The vast majority of my open source
    applications are built around open datasets provided by government organizations. I volunteer for a group
    called <a href="https://betacity.ca" target="_blank">Beta City YEG</a>, which is a local civic tech group devoted to "connecting
    public employees, citizens, and members of Edmonton's tech / data community in order to address the city and
    region's pressing issues." Here is my <a href="https://betacity.ca/2015/12/20/yeg-historical-photo-mapping/" target="_blank">
    latest contribution</a> to the group.

    When I am coding for fun, I enjoy working in a variety of languages. I am presently using
    Python, Haskell, and Node.js in my miscellaneous side projects. Out of those 3 languages listed, Haskell is my
    favourite! I typically find that if my Haskell code compiles, there is a high probability that it
    functions as intended ;)
